# Node.js CRUD API for User Management

This is a simple Node.js HTTP server that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data. The user data is stored in a local `data.json` file, which is loaded and saved to the file system for persistence.

## Features:
- **GET** `/data`: Retrieve all users.
- **POST** `/data`: Add a new user.
- **PUT** `/data/{id}`: Update an existing user by their ID.
- **DELETE** `/data/{id}`: Delete a user by their ID.

## Prerequisites:
To run this application, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (No external dependencies for this project):

   This project uses only the built-in Node.js modules, so you don’t need to install any additional packages.

## How to Run the Application

1. Make sure the project is inside a folder on your computer.

2. **Start the server**:

   Run the following command to start the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:3001`.

3. **Test the API** using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or `curl` commands.

## API Endpoints

### 1. **GET** `/data`

Retrieve all users in the database.

#### Example:

```bash
GET http://localhost:3001/data
```

Response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "email": "jane@example.com"
  }
]
```

### 2. **POST** `/data`

Add a new user.

#### Example:

```bash
POST http://localhost:3001/data
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Kate Johnson",
  "email": "kate@example.com"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": 3,
  "name": "Kate Johnson",
  "email": "kate@example.com"
}
```

### 3. **PUT** `/data/{id}`

Update an existing user by ID.

#### Example:

```bash
PUT http://localhost:3001/data/1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

### 4. **DELETE** `/data/{id}`

Delete a user by their ID.

#### Example:

```bash
DELETE http://localhost:3001/data/1
```

Response: (No content, status code 204)

### Data Format

The user data is stored in a `data.json` file with the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
  }
]
```

## File Structure

```
├── data.json             # Stores the user data
├── server.js             # Main application code
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Could not load users from `data.json`**: If `data.json` does not exist or is malformed, the application will still run but won't load any existing users. Make sure the `data.json` file is in the correct format or delete it to reset the data.
- **Permissions Issue**: Ensure you have the proper permissions to read/write to the `data.json` file on your system.
